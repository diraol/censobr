Description: Download data data from Brazil's population census. The package is 
             built on top of the Arrow platform <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/>, 
             which allow users to work with larger-than-memory census data using 
             dplyr <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/arrow.html#analyzing-arrow-data-with-dplyr>.
             At the moment, censobr only includes microdata from the 2010 census, 
             but it is being expanded to cover more years and data sets.
